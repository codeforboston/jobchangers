# Overview
In order to make a start on the project, we picked the career coach. This page will be a single page with three columns where the user moves left to right with this as a goal/path:
 * What are you now? (Enter SOC Code/Text)
 * What can you be? Provide the top 5 transitioned position destinations
 * How can you get there? (education/skills/wage employment-median salary)

# FrontEnd
The front end uses node/React/D3 for data visualization.

# BackEnd
The back end uses a postgres database to feed an api layer run by Django. 
The application is run within docker.
